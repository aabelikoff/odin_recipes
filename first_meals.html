        <h2>First meals</h2>
        <p><strong>First meals</strong> is crucial because it takes the body out of ‘sleep mode’</p>
        <p> When you wake up from sleep, your body has already used up all the nutrients you 
            consumed and is looking for fresh fuel to get started. If you do not want to have breakfast, 
            that is entirely up to you. However, having a nutritious and filling breakfast can keep you 
            from overeating later in the day. An ideal first meal should have enough carbohydrates to 
            provide you with the energy to go on with your daily duties.
            It should also have sufficient proteins to kickstart your metabolism.</p>
